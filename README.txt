This part is just to explain what I did for each challenge:

1. Add elemental types to the classes.
- I ripped off Pokemon, same multiplier, same type. Fire, water, and grass types are the three I used for this.

1b. Give advantages, like rock paper scissors, or like pokemon.

2. Add a random chance to do critical damage.
- A critical hit is a flat 5% chance for every entity.

3. Add a speed stat that helps determine which character goes first.
- It is an implemented feature but I didn't add anything that actually explicitly indicates it. The entity that attacks first is the one whose attack gets displayed on the top line.

4. Add a small random chance to dodge or miss. Have a speed stat on the class that will impact this.
- A dodge is a 2% chance of happening, but for every speed the entitiy has, the RNG gets rerolled.

5a. Add consumable items, do this by making a class for items with name, and healing/damage.
5b. Add an inventory to the character classes by making a vector attribute.

6a. Add the ability to fight multiple enemies, either one at a time orâ€¦
- I made it so that every time an enemy is defeated it'll deploy another one until the enemy party is gone.

6b. Allow all enemies to attack the player but let the player pick which enemy to attack.
- not really possible for my game since it's 1 on 1

7a. Add a party system that allows the player to switch which character is fighting.

7b. Let all allies attack enemies each turn.
- Made my head hurt trying to think of a fun idea so I scrapped it and made it Pokemon...
